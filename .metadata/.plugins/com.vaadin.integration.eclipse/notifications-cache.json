It can be tough to convince the project lead of a new feature, even if you wrote a quality implementation and documentation of it. Sometimes it can be hard to even get a bugfix incorporated.

Many of Vaadin's unique capabilities are based on the way the entire UI state is stored in a server-side user session. For this reason, our recommendation is to rely on session replication as little as possible. Depending on the use case, there are alternatives that don't rely on session replication or that reduce its use.","title":"Session Replication in the World of Vaadin","draft":"false","imageUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/image\/image_gallery?img_id=3851299&t=1385741714872","linkUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/blog\/session-replication-in-the-world-of-vaadin","iconUrl":"https:\/\/vaadin.com\/documents\/10187\/10395\/tori-icon-blue-bg-90px\/4597dffb-3868-4711-b422-8fc3e71844e6?t=1394217295000","id":"44311","validTo":"2019-04-12T00:00:00Z"},{"orFilters":"false","read":"false","linkText":"Read more","notificationType":"5","validFrom":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","body":"<img alt=\"Training_campaign\" src=\"\/documents\/15339969\/0\/Training_blogsmall.jpg\/5ba710d7-00ed-408c-b1cb-422dcfba6660?t=1549364048834\" \/> <br \/> <br \/> To help developers accelerate their adoption of the latest Vaadin technology, we have decided to make a part of our training videos available to all community members for free.
